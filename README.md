<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">Let's say there's no bad breath, I mean you two have brushed not after eating garlic or onion ooo, no go spoil show abeg 🤣.  </p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;" >When you guys locks lips, there are many skills you can use your tongue in doing not just sucking the lip.

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">You see when you've locked your lip, bring out your tongue in a straight form and start using it to fcuk his mouth.</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">You keep fvcking his mouth with your tongue while locking lip together.</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">Don't separate your lip, make sure it's well locked.</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">After fvcking him with the tongue 👅, use your tongue to tickle his upper wall , while doing that the sensation will increase.</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">Take his or her tongue in your mouth and suck it all.</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">Swallow all his saliva. Lick his lip, like you're licking spilled ice cream. 😋</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">Use all of your tongue to lick his teeth and after that suck his jaw with your mouth.💥</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;">Make sure you're both neat to avoid licking dirt. When you're done use your tongue to tickle his or her eyeballs.</p>

<p style=" color:fuchsain; font-weight: bold; font-size:13px;"> and and and.................................</p>

<p style="color:fuchsia; font-size:13px; font-weight: bold;">Some are successful in the morning, some in the afternoon and others in the evining according to God's plan to them. Never envy anyone. Never mock anyone. They are just in their timezone and you in yours.</p>
<p style="color:fuchsia; font-size:13px; font-weight: bold; ">You are not too late . You are not too early. You are just on your timezone. Destiny will set up for you.</p>
